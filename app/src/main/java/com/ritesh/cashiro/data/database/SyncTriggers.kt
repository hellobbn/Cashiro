/**
 * Local change capture for multi-device sync (see docs/sync.md).
 *
 * Every synced table has `sync_id` (a record's identity across devices) and `sync_updated_at`
 * (epoch millis of its last local change). SQLite triggers keep both and queue each change in
 * `sync_outbox`, so every write path (DAOs, raw SQL, imports, cascades) is covered without
 * touching the DAOs:
 *
 * - after insert: a row without a sync id, or with one another row already has (code that copies
 *   an entity with `copy(id = 0)` copies its sync id too), gets a fresh one; the row is stamped
 *   and an UPSERT queued.
 * - after update: the sync id never changes (an update that blanks or replaces it gets the old one
 *   back); the row is stamped and an UPSERT queued.
 * - after delete: a DELETE is queued.
 *
 * Nothing is captured while `sync_control.applying_remote` is 1: a later phase sets it, inside one
 * transaction, while it writes changes that came from another device. `sync_control.capturing` is
 * set by the triggers themselves around the row update they make, so that update does not
 * capture itself.
 *
 * The triggers are not part of Room's schema. [install] creates them (IF NOT EXISTS) from the
 * 70→71 migration, and [Callback] on every create and open, which also turns on
 * `recursive_triggers` so rows an `INSERT OR REPLACE` deletes queue their DELETE.
