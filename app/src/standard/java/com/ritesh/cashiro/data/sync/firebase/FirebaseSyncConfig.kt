/**
 * The Firebase project behind sync, from its google-services.json. None of these is a secret:
 * they name the project and the app; access is guarded by Firebase Auth and the Firestore rules
 * (`users/{uid}/...` readable and writable only by that uid), and the data by end-to-end
 * encryption. Kept as code rather than through the google-services plugin, which fails for
 * variants whose applicationId has no client in the json (the benchmark build).
